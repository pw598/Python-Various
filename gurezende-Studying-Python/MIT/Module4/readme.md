# Recommendation Systems

In this project, I have created three different types of Recommendation Systems using Python and the **surprise** package.
* I have created a Popularity Based Recommender
* Created an Item-Based Recommender: Collaborative Filtering
* Created a Model-Based Recommender with SVD algorithm (matrix factorization).
